## Sample Plugin
Sample plugin for garment creation is available <a href="https://gitlab.com/browzwear/share/open-platform/client-api/-/tree/master/sample-plugins/python/GarmentCreation" target="_blank">here</a>

## Create Shape
The code snippet below shows how to create a new shape. <br/>
After the shape creation, there will be no representation of this shape in the system until you add edges to this shape. For more information, refer to [Create Edge](Create-Edge.md).
